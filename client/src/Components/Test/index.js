        <p>We don’t serve their kind here! What? Your droids. They’ll have to wait outside. We don’t want them here. Listen, why don’t you wait out by the speeder. We don’t want any trouble. I heartily agree with you sir. Negola dewaghi wooldugger?!? He doesn’t like you. I’m sorry. I don’t like you either You just watch yourself. We’re wanted men. I have the death sentence in twelve systems. I’ll be careful than. You’ll be dead. This little one isn’t worth the effort. Come let me buy you something…</p>

        <p>The approach will not be easy. You are required to maneuver straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point. The target area is only two meters wide. It’s a small thermal exhaust port, right below the main port. The shaft leads directly to the reactor system. A precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the station. Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction. The shaft is ray-shielded, so you’ll have to use proton torpedoes. That’s impossible, even for a computer. It’s not impossible. I used to bull’s-eye womp rats in my T-sixteen back home. They’re not much bigger than two meters. Man your ships! And may the Force be with you!</p>
        
        <p>Luke? Luke? Luke? Have you seen Luke this morning? He said he had some things to do before he started today, so he left early. Uh? Did he take those two new droids with him? I think so. Well, he’d better have those units in the south range repaired be midday or there’ll be hell to pay! Wait, there’s something dead ahead on the scanner. It looks like our droid…hit the accelerator.</p>
        
        <p>There. You see Lord Vader, she can be reasonable. Continue with the operation. You may fire when ready. What? You’re far too trusting. Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration. But don’t worry. We will deal with your Rebel friends soon enough. No! Commence primary ignition.</p>
        
        <p>Threepio! Come in, Threepio! Threepio! Get to the top! I can’t Where could he be? Threepio! Threepio, will you come in? They aren’t here! Something must have happened to them. See if they’ve been captured. Hurry! One thing’s for sure. We’re all going to be a lot thinner! Get on top of it! I’m trying! Thank goodness, they haven’t found them! Where could they be? Use the comlink? Oh, my! I forgot I turned it off! Are you there, sir? Threepio! We’ve had some problems… Will you shut up and listen to me? Shut down all garbage mashers on the detention level, will you? Do you copy? Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level. Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level. No. Shut them all down! Hurry! Listen to them! They’re dying, Artoo! Curse my metal body! I wasn’t fast enough. It’s all my fault! My poor master! Threepio, we’re all right! We’re all right. You did great.</p>
